# BlendShift
Smooth frame-interpolated color cycling in Unity

Keep the "BlendShift" folder directly in your project's assets folder. Dragging and dropping a ".lbm" file will create a SpriteRenderer prefab and various files to support it. The sprite renderer will display in play but not in edit mode.

You will still need to edit project specific settings for your sprites, such as pixels per unit, sorting layer, or order in layer.
